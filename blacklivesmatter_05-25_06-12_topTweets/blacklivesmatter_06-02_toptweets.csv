8171,2020-06-02 07:12:33+00:00,112,this blackout trend on IG is actually so confusing to me. who organized it/did it originate from a pro-Black org? what is its purpose? How does this provide tangible and meaningful support to the #BlackLivesMatter movement? I’m so wary of this trend. Would love answers!!!
8172,2020-06-02 07:12:25+00:00,7172,Y’all #blackoutuesday is NOT a #BlackLivesMatter initiative! It’s wildly illogical NOT to show solidarity from a place of privilege right now and it fills their feed with empty space DONT spread it! Please research bandwagons before jumping on during a literal fascist takeover.

8177,2020-06-02 07:11:33+00:00,248,you can still participate in this!! But it wouldn’t be MUCH more helpful to flood the tag with relevant and updated information on #BlackLivesMatter and the protest. Flooding the tag at this time is doing damage rather than helping!!! 
8178,2020-06-02 07:11:28+00:00,506,The blackout campaign is literal media suppression now more than ever we have to post what’s happening to coordinate and spread information. Now the entire #BlackLivesMatter tag is full of black squares. We still need to donate. We still need to locate people.
8179,2020-06-02 07:11:26+00:00,44,The climate movement is all like 'how can we stand in solidarity with #BlackLivesMatter?' without reflecting on the reason they don't know is because they don't hire people of colour.
